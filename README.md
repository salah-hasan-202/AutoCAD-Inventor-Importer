This project enables seamless loading and importing of Autodesk Inventor (R) files into FreeCAD (v0.18 or greater), allowing users to work with professional CAD data directly inside FreeCAD. It extends interoperability between platforms and simplifies the transition of complex designs into an open-source environment.

Currently, the importer supports Inventor Part files (IPT). These parts can be fully displayed and used within FreeCAD, making it possible to review geometry, analyze models, and integrate them into new projects. Support for assemblies (IAM), drawings (IDW), and presentations (IPN) is not yet available.

Since Inventor files contain a complete ACIS model representation, the system can also import SAT and SAB files into FreeCAD. This ensures reliable geometry transfer, preserving solid modeling data with high accuracy and consistency.

In addition, Fusion 360 files that contain ACIS-based geometry can also be opened in FreeCAD. This provides users with greater flexibility when working across different CAD platforms that rely on compatible solid modeling kernels.

These import capabilities significantly improve cross-platform workflow, enabling engineers and designers to reuse existing CAD data without manual reconstruction. By supporting industry-standard geometry formats, the tool enhances collaboration, productivity, and data exchange within professional design environments.
